# Mockingbird
#### Discord chat bot that selects random players and divides players into random teams

## Setup

### Installation

Use [poetry](https://github.com/sdispater/poetry) to install Python dependencies:

### Configuration

Mockingbird uses [python-dotenv](https://github.com/theskumar/python-dotenv) to read environment variables in from your local `.env` file. See `.env-sample` for configuration options.

## Execution

Once setup is complete, you can run Mockingbird via `bot.py`:

    poetry run python bot.py
